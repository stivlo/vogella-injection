= Spring Dependency Injection =

Self contained tiny Spring Application that shows how to select one of the two
possible implementations of an IWriter interface. I created the plumbing with
Spring Roo. It's different from Vogella example, since I didn't put the @Service
annotation in writer.Writer and writer.NiceWriter, so I can insert the implementation
to be used in src/main/resources/META-INF/spring/applicationContext.xml

The testbean.MySpringBeanWithDependency instead is declared as @Service and @Autowired
on the constructor, so that there is no way to create an object without the mandatory
dependency and I have only to name the implementation to use in applicationContext.xml
and I don't need to specify explicitly the plumbing of MySpringBeanWithDependency.
